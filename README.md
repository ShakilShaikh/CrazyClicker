# CrazyClicker

## Best farming tool for IDLE games

Tired of clicking for hours to earn rewards in your favorite IDLE games? Is your macro tool running too slow? Don't want to use Achievement Unlocker apps that might compromise your game integrity?

**CrazyClicker** is here to provide the most efficient way to automate clicking in your games, delivering up to 100 clicks per second on average!

### Features

- **High Speed**: Achieve up to 100 clicks per second.
- **User-Friendly**: Simply compile, run, and enter your desired number of clicks.
- **Customizable Delay**: Set a custom delay before the clicking starts, allowing you to switch to the game window smoothly.
- **Efficient**: Minimizes the time you spend actively managing repetitive tasks in games.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Microsoft Visual Studio (for MSVC users) or any other IDE/compiler of your choice.

#### Compiling the Code

1. **Clone the repository** or download the source code.
2. **Open your C++ IDE or compiler**.
3. **Navigate to the project directory** and open the `.cpp` file.
4. **Compile the project**:
   - For Visual Studio: Build the solution.
   - For command-line compilers: Navigate to the project directory and run `g++ CrazyClicker.cpp -o CrazyClicker.exe -luser32`.

#### Running the Application

1. **Open a command prompt or terminal**.
2. **Navigate to the directory containing the compiled `CrazyClicker.exe` file**.
3. **Execute the program**: `./CrazyClicker`.
4. **Enter the number of clicks** you want when prompted.
5. **Specify the delay** (in seconds) before the program starts clicking.
6. **Switch to your game window** during the delay period.

### Important Notes

- By default, you have 5 seconds after executing the file to switch to your desired window.
- Ensure you are in the correct window where the clicks are needed, as the tool will click wherever the mouse cursor is positioned.
