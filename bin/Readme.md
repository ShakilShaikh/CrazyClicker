# CrazyClicker Pre-built Executables

## Quick Start with CrazyClicker

If you're looking to get started quickly without compiling the source code, you've come to the right place. This directory contains pre-built executable files for CrazyClicker, along with all necessary DLL files embedded, ensuring a seamless start for those who prefer not to compile the source themselves.

### Using the Executables

1. **Download the Executable**:
   - Choose the `CrazyClicker.exe` file in this directory.
   
2. **Run the Program**:
   - Double-click the `CrazyClicker.exe` file or run it from a command prompt or terminal.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to set the number of clicks and the delay before clicking starts.

3. **Switch to Your Game**:
   - Make sure to switch to the window where you want the clicks to occur during the initial delay specified when running the executable.

### Why Compile from Source?

While using pre-built executables is convenient, compiling from the source provides several benefits:

- **Customization**: Modify the source code to tailor the functionality to your specific needs.
- **Learning**: Understand how the code works and improve your coding skills by exploring and modifying the source.
- **Up-to-Date**: Ensure you're using the latest version of the software with all recent improvements and bug fixes.

### Compiling from Source

If you decide to compile CrazyClicker from the source:

1. Navigate back to the main project directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the main `README.md` to set up your environment and compile the code.
